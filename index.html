        <h1>Overview - What is this website about?</h1>
        <p>This website was created to help people who are less than technologically literate. My goal is to make sure that people who are new to computers or who are unsure about them have a place to go to find information on how to be safe that’s not filled with ads, spam or false information. </p>
        <p>This website will cover aspects of security and what you can do to ensure you’re safe online. It will also show some of the common internet scams that you should be wary of and hopefully make you think a little bit.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions, you think this something on this website needs correcting or you would like another topic covered because its something your unsure of, please fill out my contact form with your suggestions and I will see what I can do about adding the topic in the future. </p>
        <h2>Who am I to be giving this advice?</h2>
        <p>I am a 27 year old First Year E.I.T Computer Systems Student who has been working with computers my whole life. I built my first PC in my teens, Taught myself programming in my early 20s and have been teaching people computer stuff for years. I'm the person people in my family call when something goes wrong with their technology and they need someone they trust to help them fix it and avoid that mistake again.</p>
