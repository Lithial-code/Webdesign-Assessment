        <h2>Advance fee fraud</h2>
        <p>A scammer requests fees up front for goods, services, money or rewards that they never supply. They invent a convincing reason for requesting payment such as to cover taxes or fees. Sometimes they ask for payment in wire transfer or gift card. These scams come from before the internet and we’re originally done by sending out thousands of letters but was made easier and cheaper by mass email.</p>

        <h2>Lottery, sweepstakes or competition scams.</h2>
        <p>Correspondence appears from out of nowhere saying that you have won money or a fantastic prize in a lottery or competition that you did not enter. These scams try to convince you to give money or personal info upfront in order to receive the prize. Scammers will claim that they need to pay taxes or fees before you can claim your prize. Sometimes they even have a premium phone number that charges you if you call them.</p>

        <h2>Dating and romance scams.</h2>
        <p>Also known as catfishing.
          Scammers create fake profiles on legitimate dating websites. They use these profiles to enter a relationship with you so they can get a hold of your money and personal details. Sometimes they will ask for money to help with costs associated with travel, illness, injury or crisis. They will seek to exploit your emotions by pulling on your heart strings. Sometimes they will take months or even years to build the relationship enough to get what they want.

        <h2>Computer hacking.</h2>
        <p>Phishing emails are commonly used by scammers to trick you into giving them access to your computer. They “fish” for your details by encouraging you to click on a link or attachment. If you click the link, malicious software will be installed on your computer allowing them access to all of your files and information. A phishing email often appears to come from an organisation that you trust like a bank. They ask you to enter your login information and then redirect it to the original site while also sending the information to their databases for later use.</p>
