    <h1>Emails</h1>
    <p>Not all emails you get are real. Some are people looking to steal your information by pretending to be someone else but you can be vigilant and check some things to keep yourself safe. </p>
    <p>
      First look at the email address. Is it an email from someone you know?  Is it spelled correctly? Sometimes the email will look fine but the email address will be something like <strong> returns@companyname236465937whdnkdh.as.zr </strong> which obviously isn’t a real email address but unless you actually check you wouldn’t know
    </p>
    <p>
      Next thing to look at is the emailed spelled correctly. A lot of the time these kind of scams come from countries where English isn’t the first language so the spelling can be pretty bad at times. This can be a give away that the email you got isn’t real as most businesses will have their emails spell checked properly to be more professional.
    </p>
    <p>
      Does the email have a suspicious button link. If you hover over a button you can see in the bottom left hand corner of your browser what the link will be. Say you’re looking at a email from the bank but the link wants to send you to http://www.stealyourdetails.com. You would know that this isn’t the bank. Now I know this seems like a silly example but you should be able to tell if the link is from your bank or not. If your unsure you can always contact the company that you think sent the email through their official channels without using the email to ask. They will be able to tell you if the email is real or fake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly be careful of what attachments you download. Sometimes files contain malicious code that will damage your files or steal your identity. If you are worried about an emails validity then you definitely don’t want to download any attachments it may include. Only open attachments from people you know and trust.
