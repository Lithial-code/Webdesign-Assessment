    <h1>Antivirus</h1>
    <p>
      For antivirus there are a couple of recommendations that I have and a couple I think most people will find super annoying. Antivirus is still required if your using any version of Windows as your computers operating system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antivirus comes in a couple of varieties. There are free programs and paid programs and both do different things depending on your needs. Free Antivirus programs are generally considered enough to keep you safe online. BUT that comes with the cost that you generally have to follow the advice of a website like this one. Paid Antivirus has a bunch of interesting extra features that help keep your computer safe. These include features like child protections so you can lock younger people using the computer out of certain types of websites as well as monitoring to see what they are getting up to online. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Which one you choose is up to you but I will offer a couple of recommendations and you can choose the one that you feel is best for you.

  <div class="av-content-right">
      <h2>Free - Kaspersky</h2>
    <p> 
      My personal choice for free antivirus as of the end of 2019 is Kaspersky free. Its doesn’t use a lot of computer resources, it protects well and it doesn’t interrupt what your are doing unless something bad is happening. It just runs quietly in the background and keeps you safe. 
    </p>
    <h2>
      Paid - Norton
    </h2>
    <p>
      For your paid option I would recommend Norton. It comes with decent child proofing, a password manager (We will talk about why you want one of those (here)) and some cloud back up for some of your important files. It’s also reasonably cheap and can be brought at range of stores worldwide as well as online (here).
